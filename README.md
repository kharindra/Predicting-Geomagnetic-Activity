# Predicting Solar wind properties at 1~au
Capstone project


**Problem Statement**

---

=> The main goal of this project is to predict the solar wind properties at the Earth's trajectory and find a robust model that can expect them from the sunspot number. There are several physics-based models to predict solar wind, which includes thermodynamics    

**Background study**

What is Solar wind:
Sunspot solar cycle:

Solar wind Properties at 1~au:

- Plasma density
- Magnetic field strength
- Plasma temperature
- Solar Wind Speed
