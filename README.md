# Predicting Solar wind properties at 1~au

---

**Problem Statement**

The main goal of this project is to predict the solar wind properties at the Earth's trajectory and find a robust model that can expect them from the sunspot number. There are several physics-based models to predict solar wind, which include thermodynamics
