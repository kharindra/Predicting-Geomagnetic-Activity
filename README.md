# Predicting Solar wind properties at 1~au

---

**Problem Statement**

The main goal of this project is to predict the solar wind properties at the Earth's trajectory and to develop a machine learning web application that can predict them from the sunspot number. There are several physics-based models that are computationally expensive to predict solar wind, which include thermodynamics that heat and accelerate them, wave heating (ion-cyclotron waves), and micro-flare (or nano-flare) heating are the most commonly identified heating mechanisms for solar wind heating. The primary input of these models is the solar magnetogram data, which is the photospheric (solar surface) magnetic field observations.

Sunspot solar cycle:

Solar wind Properties at 1~au:

- Plasma density (Np)
- Magnetic field strength (B)
- Plasma temperature (T[K])
- Solar Wind Speed (Ur)

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs)

**Kp-index**

- The Kp-index is a scale used to characterize the magnitude of geomagnetic disturbances. 
- A geomagnetic storm starts at Kp5 after which the G-scale is also used.

##
Kp0 = Quiet
Kp1 = Quiet
Kp2 = Quiet
Kp3 = Unsettled
Kp4 = Active
Kp5 = Minor storm (G1)
Kp6 = Moderate storm (G2)
Kp7 = Strong storm (G3)
Kp8 = Severe storm (G4)
Kp9 = Extreme storm (G5)
